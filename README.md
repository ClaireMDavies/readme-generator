## Future versions
I had hoped to be able to create this project dynamically, so that it could be applied in real world scenarios.  I would go about this by using the license api that is available for github to retrieve the license info, and manipulate that to help create the necessary information for the readme.  

Also by using data from inquirer, such as the question about how many developers were involved in the project, to then enable more developers and their github profiles to be added to the readme file. 

I also wanted to see about creating the functionality to allow the uploading of images into the readme generator, to be displayed in the usage section of the readme.
